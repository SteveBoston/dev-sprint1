What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask?

	The route is the path the app is using. Specified with: @app.route("/")



What is the only route we’ve specified in our application?	

	@app.route("/")


What is the method that gets called when we hit that route?

	def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
	

If I wanted to add a route at “/world” that printed “Hello, World” on the screen, what would that code look like?

	@app.route("/world")
	def hello():
   	 return "Hello World!"

If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code 
under the ‘if __name__ == “__main__”: be executed? Why not?

	No. Code in that location is executed only if the program is run directly.


*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***

			{% for message in messages %}
{{message}}
					{% endfor %}


*** What is the for loop doing? ***

	It displays the messages that the user enters in the text box.
